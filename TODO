The current failures might be because congruence isn't being maintained properly downwards, I think...?
Instead, we might do this manually for merging positive constructor info in the e-graphs analysis modify function?

If this works, the major todos are
* Propagating strictness annotations to underlying newtypes (likely modify analysis)
* Clean up equality
    * How to do Ord Type?
* Clean up solver
    * Merge args of data cons when merging by congruence (likely modify analysis as well)
